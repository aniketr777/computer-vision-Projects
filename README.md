#  Computer Vision Projects

Welcome to my collection of beginner-to-intermediate computer vision projects built using Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, and YOLO. These projects aim to explore real-time human interaction, attention monitoring, gesture control, and more using modern computer vision techniques.
